=head1 NAME

url-hint - Extension for URxvt which brings a hint mode to follow URLs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This B<URxvt> extension adds a hint mode to the terminal emulator, which
highlights URLs.
A pattern is presented for each URL, which can be used to open the URL using a
user defined application.
B<url-hint> is inspired by the hint mode of vimperator (or similar
browser extensions).

To enter the hint mode, create a B<URxvt> I<keysym> resource which invokes
the I<url-hint:hint> action.
Once the hint mode is activated, you can exit it again by pressing either the
key specified by the I<url-hint.exit-keysym> resource, or the Escape key.
Use the B<xev> utility to find the name of the desired keysym.

B<NOTE>: For I<url-hint.exit-keysym>, the keysym description used by B<URxvt>
itself (using the 'M-' or 'C-' prefix) is not supported.
Please see the description of the B<XStringToKeysym> function for further
details.

The letters used to create the patterns can be defined by using the
I<url-hint.hint-chars> resource.
Each character of the given string will be used to create the patterns.
The length of each pattern depends on the number of visible URLs on the screen.
If the screen changes (because more output is generated by a program, or the
screen is scrolled-back), the generated patterns might change.

While the pattern is typed (and therefore not yet fully provided), the already
provided part is not presented on the screen directly.
But the pattern for each URL, which starts with the given input, changes its
font to indicate which part of the pattern has already been provided.
If the screen changes, the partially provided pattern might be reset.

The application which is used to open the URL is configured by the resource
I<url-hint.launcher>.

=head1 EXAMPLE RESOURCE

The following shows an example resource configuration with the default values
for each resource entry:
